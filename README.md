Things that are done.
	- Every service inside the CaseMGMT now returns a response. Except for
		- CaseForwardService (reason I couldnt understand the code as most of it is commented out. Should it be implemented or is it on purpose.)
		- Case report service (Reason I dont know what XAPI is and it is showing red so If u could tell me what it is.)
	- There might be errors here and there because of the adjustment of the return types will work on those tmrw maybe.
